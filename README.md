I don't know what i'm doing. the API got no id on each object. it's too difficult to me.

no matter how difficult or the result is...
i'm going to complete this!

due to difficult and the absence of ID of object on API,
I'm using https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums/1/photos as the api.

the features on this app had two dropdown button. but unfortunately,
the button is unactive and it's differen from the design because no checkbox.
the only active feature is search by name which you can acces by inputting text on input box
thank you for your opportunity :)
